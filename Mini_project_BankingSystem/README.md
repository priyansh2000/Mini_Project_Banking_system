## Overview of Lab Exercises

### HOL 1: File and Process Management

In this section, you will find exercises that cover various aspects of file and process management using system calls in C. The exercises include:

- Creating and managing files (hard links, soft links, FIFOs).
- Performing basic file operations like reading, writing, and copying files.
- Implementing process management concepts such as forking processes, creating zombies and orphan processes, and handling signals.
- Working with file descriptors and demonstrating the use of pipes and inter-process communication.

### HOL 2: System Software-II

The second set of lab exercises delves into advanced concepts such as:

- Setting timers and measuring resource limits.
- Creating and managing threads.
- Implementing signal handling mechanisms and inter-process communication.
- Working with message queues and shared memory.

These exercises are designed to enhance your understanding of system-level programming and the underlying mechanisms of operating systems.

## Mini Project: Banking Management System

The Banking Management System aims to simulate core banking functionalities, including:

- Customer account management (viewing balances, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers).
- Loan processing and administrative oversight.
- Role-based access for customers, employees, managers, and administrators.

### Key Features

1. **Customer Role**: Customers can log in, manage their accounts, and view transaction histories.
2. **Bank Employee Role**: Employees manage customer accounts and loan applications.
3. **Manager Role**: Managers can activate or deactivate accounts and oversee operations.
4. **Administrator Role**: Administrators manage both customer and employee accounts, with the highest level of access.
